# MatrixNet
Simple multilayer perceptron neural network library which I wrote to learn about machine learning. After importing, a Network object can be created with a certain strucutre, input data and target outputs as arguments. The cost after each iteration over the training data can be optionally printed to the console.

Bias nodes have not been implemented, but the network seems to function well without them. Numpy matrices are used to simplify the code and maintain readability.

More detailed directions for use of the library can be found in comments at the top of the script.
