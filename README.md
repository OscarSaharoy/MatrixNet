# MatrixNet
Simple multilayer perceptron neural network script which I wrote to learn about machine learning.

Relies on matrixes and uses numpy to handle parallel calculations. The script can be modified to change the training data or the structure of the network. 

The network has no bias nodes, which should be added in future. However, good fits to the sample training data I have used can be reached.

This script may be useful to those trying to learn about implementations of the backpropagation algorithm, and a commentated version is availible.
